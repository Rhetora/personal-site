This article aims to provide a comprehensive guide to the different options available for building climbing anchors on sport climbs, where the anchor station provides two well positioned and solid bolts. The configuration what is attached to these bolts can differ, but these anchor should be adaptable to the different setups you may find.

Multipitch anchors will focus on a setup using a clove hitch to attach the leader, and a guide style belay device.

# Classic Anchors
 There are a number of common anchors that widely used on sport climbs around the world, both for building toprope anchors, and on multipitch climbs.

## Quickdraws 
### Toprope
One of the most common methods used to build toprope anchors is to use two opposed quickdraws clipped in to the two bolts, or chains/rings if provided. This method is best used when you only have quickdraws available, and the anchor will not see a lot toproping use. Locking quickdraws can be used, but are uncommon.

#### How to build:

1.  Clip the left quickdraw's bolt side carabiner to the left bolt with the gates of both carabiners facing left.
2. Clip the right quickdraws to the right bolt with the gates facing right similarly to the left quickdraw.
3. Clip the rope through the rope (bottom) carabiner on each quickdraw.

#### Advantages
- Uses minimal gear that you likely already have
- Extremely simple and quick to setup

#### Disadvantages
- Not as secure as every carabiner is likely a snapgate
- If bolts are far apart the angle created can be large, putting more force on the bolts
- If bolts are not alligned horizontally the heights of the bottom carabiners cannot be adjusted, and they will not line up

## BFK (Big freaking knot)

The BFK anchor is an extremely common and simple anchor that is extremely secure. It consists of two locking carabiners attaching a sling or cord (at least 120cm) to the two bolts, with a knot tied in the length between the bolts to create a master point loop to clip in to. An overhand knot can be used if you only have a short length as it requires less length, but a figure 8 knot is easier to untie.
### Toprope
This anchor creates a very secure top rope anchor that is simple to tie, but does not self equalise if the loaded direction moves.

#### How to build:
1. Clip a locking carabiner to the left bolt with the widepoint down, and the gate facing left.
2. Mirror this on the right bolt.
3. Clip and 120cm or longer cord/sling to both bolts, and pull down in the middle.
4. Form a bight from the sling length hanging down between the bolts and tie an overhand or figure of 8, forming a loop.
5. Clip 1 or 2 locking carabiners to this loop with the wide point down, if using two make sure the gates face opposite directions.
6. Clip the rope into both carabiners and lock all 3/4 carabiners.

### Multipitch
The BFK anchor can also be used when multipitching. The main difference here is that the belay device can be clipped in to the loop created by the knots, and the leader can clove hitch into a carabiner clipped into the same loop.

#### How to build:

1-4 as above.

5. Clip a locking carabiner into the loop and clove hitch yourself in.
6. Clip another carabiner into the loop, and setup a belay device on this.

#### Advantages
- Simple to tie and inspect
- Secure, and redundant if a bolt fails
- Does not shockload if a bolt fails

#### Disadvantages
- Does not self equalise
- Can be difficult to untie when loaded.
- Requires a number of specific items.
- Loop can be awkward to fit two carabiners into for multipitching.
- The leader is coupled to the direction of pull from the belay device.
