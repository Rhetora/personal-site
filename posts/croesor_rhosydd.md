We decided to start the trip on the evening of the 26th, parking in Croesor at around 7pm, and rapidly changed and packed in the car park. We then started on a steep slog up the road to the Croesor entrance, passing a farmer on a quad with his dogs who told us we were crazy after telling him our plan. We reached the entrance just before sunset, where we enjoyed the views over the old mine buildings and mountains. We then donned our harnesses, and started into the mine!

We started off down the narrow mineshaft until it started to widen after an old gate, just ahead there was some old electronic mine equipment. Just ahead of this, we found a window on the right which opened into a large cavern with a lake below us. At this point, we thought this was the first rappel as there were a few bolts in the ceiling, but no rope.  

After realising this wasn't the first rappel, we climbed up an old wall with some in situ ropes, and carried on up a sloping passage until reaching another window that was actually the first pitch! The in situ rope here looked quite worn in sections, and as the anchor placement was decent for a pull-through, I rigged up our rope and set up Poppy to rappel first. With Poppy safely on the ground, I then rappelled down awkwardly with our third bag hanging between my legs.

The next section was a huge chamber with lots of slate collapse in the center, we spent a while here climbing on the slate and generally struggling to find the way through to the next section. After reassessing from the start, we found the next pitch in the far corner, with a solid, but interesting anchor system slung around a number of blocks. The rope here was in better shape, and with the anchor being difficult for a pull-through we used the in situ rope.

After climbing down some sloping slate, we reached a lake with the zip line and wire bridge. While the wire bridge was definitely the simpler option, I'd brought a pulley so had to try the zipline. I rigged up an overcomplicated system that involved the climbing rope redirecting through a carabiner and being attached as a retrieval line for the pulley. This ended up not being necessary as, after watching how underwhelming the zip line was for me, Poppy decided to take the two-wire bridge instead, awkwardly hauling the rope and other gear I had left without anywhere to attach them.

We then had one more obstacle for the day, an old rickety ladder suspended by wires as a bridge. At points this involved dipping slightly into the lake but was pretty straightforward, to cross, giving great views of how blue the lakes are with headtorches up close! 

Just after the ladder bridge lake, we decided to set up camp around the corner where mining activity had made the ground smooth (Very relative term here!), as it was getting pretty late (about 1am). As my tent isn't freestanding, and pegs didn't want to go into the solid rock, a solution was improvised using large blocks of slate to snag and weigh down the peg loops. We then made a quick jetboil feast of cous cous and tinned peas and carrots, and jumped in the tent for what was not the best sleep of our lives.
