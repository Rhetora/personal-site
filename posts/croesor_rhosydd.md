We decided to start the trip on the evening of the 26th, parking in Croesor at around 7pm, where rapidly got changed and packed. We then started on a steep slog up the road to the Croesor entrance, passing a farmer on a quad with his dogs who told us we were crazy after we told him our plan. We reached the entrance just before sunset, where we enjoyed the views over the old mine buildings and mountains. We then donned our harnesses, and started into the mine!

The first section consisted of a narrow mineshaft, which then widened after going through an old gate, and we passed by some old electronic mine equipment. Just ahead of this, we found a window on the right which opened into a large cavern with a lake below us. At this point, we thought this was the first rappel as there were a few bolts in the ceiling, but no rope.  

After freaking out a little, we then realised this wasn't the first rappel, and climbed up an old wall with some in situ ropes, carrying on up a sloping passage until reaching another window that was actually the first pitch! The in situ rope here looked quite worn in sections, and as the anchor placement was decent for a pull-through, I rigged up our rope and set up Poppy on her first ever rappel. With Poppy safely on the ground, I then rappelled down awkwardly with our third bag hanging between my legs.

The next section was a huge chamber with lots of slate collapse in the center, we spent a while here climbing on the slate and generally struggling to find the way through to the next section. After reassessing from the start, and pulling out our screenshotted trip reports, we found the next pitch in the far corner, with a solid, but interesting anchor system slung around a number of blocks. The rope here was in better shape, and with the anchor being difficult for a pull-through we used the in situ rope.

After climbing down some sloping slate, we reached a lake with the zip line and wire bridge. While the wire bridge was definitely the simpler option, I'd brought a pulley so had to try the zipline. I rigged up an overcomplicated system that involved the climbing rope redirecting through a carabiner and being attached as a retrieval line for the pulley. This ended up not being necessary as, after watching how underwhelming the zip line was for me, Poppy decided to take the two-wire bridge instead, awkwardly hauling the rope and other gear I had left without anywhere to attach them.

We then had one more obstacle for the day, an old rickety ladder suspended by wires as a bridge. At points this involved dipping slightly into the lake but was pretty straightforward, to cross, giving great views of how blue the lakes are with headtorches up close!

Just after the ladder bridge lake, we decided to set up camp around the corner where mining activity had made the ground smooth (Very relative term here!), as it was getting pretty late (about 1am). As my tent isn't freestanding, and pegs didn't want to go into the solid rock, a solution was improvised using large blocks of slate to snag and weigh down the peg loops. We then made a quick jetboil feast of cous cous and tinned peas and carrots, and jumped in the tent for what was not the best sleep of our lives.

We allowed ourselves a generous lie-in of about 8am as we really wanted to make sure we got out before our friends calls SAR! It's pretty weird waking up in complete darkness. After packing up we headed to the first obstacle of the day, an old mine bridge with two thin wooden supports to balance over.

This led to a section which involved climbing around a lake on the mineshaft wall with some handlines bolted to the rock. After this we were led to one of my least favourite sections, a two wire bride with a thin rope to walk on. This was made even more difficult carrying the 3rd bag!

Finally we came to the last chamber of named obstacles, where to we came to an opening into a huge chamber with a lake below us, and a thin blue rope laying on the floor of our ledge. After giving this a tug, a canoe came floating towards us out the darkness, which was honestly pretty eerie. While I used this rope to hold to canoe relatively steady, Poppy rapelled in to the back, getting her feet pretty soaked as the canoe was half full of water which all sloshed to the back. This made the canoe extremely unsteady which made it all the more scary. She then spent a while trying to bail out water with a tupperware, which didn't seem to make any difference at all and was abandoned. After Poppy carefully moved to the front and held on to the rock wall, I rapped into the back of the canoe, trying my hardest not to capsize us into the freezing subterranean lake. To get across Poppy pulled the canoe on a rope attached to the far wall, which I focussed on keeping the canoe from capsizing.

After making it to the farside, we quickly jumped out and pulled ourself up an in situ rope onto a rock slab, which we then traversed while clipping in to other ropes. This took us to the base of the final obstacle, a rope climb section. Here Poppy went first again with her first time ascending a rope. After setting up a system of prussiks, she went up, clipping her cows tail in a few bolts scattered over the wall. Once up top, we rigged a redirect with the pulley to bring the 3rd bag up, and I repeated the same movements, finally getting me out of the canoe cavern.

The rest of the adventure was a bit of a blue, and took us much longer than expected. Despite no technical obstacles here, there was a lot of scrambling over and through collapsed slate, and a LOT of route finding involved, with us regularly getting "lost" and having to consult our saved trip reports carefully. There was a lot of ground still to cover until we were out. 

After climbing through some smalls gaps in mine walls, climbing up low, steep passages, passing old mining turntables, and squeezing through slate collapse we made to our first glimse of daylight in about 19 hours! This was the alternative exit which we weren't aiming for. Here we got pretty lost for a while, going the wrong was twice and having to backtrack. Finally we found the correct path, and were on the way out! On the way we passed a small silver Christmas tree that someone had somehow brought in and placed in a side passage! Finally, we rounded a corner, and found a long passage with a stream flowing through, and daylight at the end! After around 20 hours underground we'd made it to the exit. We emerged into the light to meet a couple of walkers having a look into the entrance.
